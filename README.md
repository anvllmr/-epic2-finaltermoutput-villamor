I created my mandala output using p5.js Web Editor. The design I choose to recreate is the Star Mandala Symbol. Stars symbolizes independence because to their self-sustaining nature. In a mandala, stars indicate confidence and the strength to stand alone. The circular designs symbolizes the thought that life is never ending and everything is connected. 

The references that I used for making the mandala output:

The additional topic that I'd like to learn about graphics programming is 3D modeling. Using softwares like Blender, Autodesk Maya and more.
